User clicks on Extension Button. If the NoteBook is open... what happens? The NoteBook is closed (with a confirm prompt)?

If the NoteBook is not open, then:
* Read from localStorage which edge the NoteBook should be shown
* Read the size for that edge (horizontal or vertical)
* Inject the HTML, CSS and JS into the main page
* Set the CSS to place the NoteBook on the appropriate edge with the given size
