The best way to learn a language is to make friends with a very patient native speaker who has the same interests as you, and who can speak and write at just the right level for you to understand.
You want to learn a new language in order to understand others and to make yourself understood. Your new language is a means of communication, not an end in itself.

You can only learn from exchanges that you understand. The more interested you are in the subject you are discussing, the more pleasure you get from learning.

Lexogram is designed to understand you. It learns what vocabulary you are comfortable with, and what topics you prefer. It looks for material which will interest you and which will introduce new expressions at just the pace that suits you. It will keep reminding you of words that you are learning until it can be sure that you have fully acquired them.

Lexogram is more tireless than any human, and never forgets what you have learnt. Lexogram will help you get along with native speakers without trying their patience.
